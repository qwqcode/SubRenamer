üéû One-click batch subtitle renaming tool

> A Subtitle File Batch Renaming Tool with One-Click Automation and Intelligence.

**Why?** If the video and subtitle filenames match, any video player can automatically load the subtitles.

**Goal?** Rename external subtitle files to match the video filenames.

## What sets SubRenamer apart from regular batch renaming software?

SubRenamer specializes in renaming subtitle files and is straightforward to use.

For most video and subtitle files, simply drag them into the program for automatic and precise recognition, allowing one-click renaming without the complex settings of typical renaming software.

**Drag & Drop Import**

[Drag & Drop Import Video Demo](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/assets/22412567/9de8fa00-6010-4b3a-83a6-2c976dc97090)

## Renaming Instructions

If the video and subtitle files are in **different** folders, the renaming process will **copy** the subtitle files to the video folder without altering the original subtitle files, so no backup is needed.

Conversely, if the video and subtitle files are in the **same** folder, the renaming process will directly modify the subtitle filenames (you can enable backup in settings to save the original subtitle files in the SubBackup directory).

The renamed subtitle filenames will match the video filenames.

## Algorithm Principle

### Automatic Matching Mode

The automatic matching mode determines the episode (extract) by comparing the differences (diff) between filenames and automatically associates video and subtitle files (mapping) to achieve automatic matching.

To perform automatic matching, you need to import at least two video files and two subtitle files with consistent naming formats.

- Algorithm Code: [SubRenamer/Matcher](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/tree/main/SubRenamer/Matcher) (entry function in [Matcher.cs](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/blob/main/SubRenamer/Matcher/Matcher.cs))
- Unit Test Code: [SubRenamer.Tests](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/tree/main/SubRenamer.Tests)
- Test Case Data: [TopLevelTests.json](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/blob/main/SubRenamer.Tests/MatcherTests/TopLevelTests.json) (**contains example data for the automatic matching algorithm**)

### Manual Matching Mode

The automatic matching mode may fail with complex filename formats, in which case you can switch to manual matching mode. Manual mode allows you to define rules (supporting simple wildcards and regular expressions). The program provides a simple editor for quickly writing matching rules.

## FAQ

**macOS can't open, says it's damaged**

There are many solutions online. Here's one method: open the terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SubRenamer.app
```

The reason is it isn't signed by an Apple developer, which requires a $99/year developer account.

**No scaling on Linux Wayland desktop environment?**

This is an upstream issue. AvaloniaUI may not scale correctly on Wayland, resulting in small text. You can set the environment variable to manually set the scaling factor at startup.

```bash
AVALONIA_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS="eDP-1=2;" ./SubRenamer
```

## Multi-Language Translation (I18n)

SubRenamer supports multiple languages. Currently available languages include:

- English
- ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Simplified Chinese)
- ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá (Traditional Chinese)

****

### Unit Testing

```bash
dotnet test SubRenamer.Tests --verbosity normal
```

Unit test code is in the [SubRenamer.Tests](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/tree/main/SubRenamer.Tests) directory. It is recommended to use Rider's built-in visual tool to run tests and view results.

**Test Data**

The [TopLevelTests.json](https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/blob/main/SubRenamer.Tests/MatcherTests/TopLevelTests.json) file contains test case data, including various subtitle and video filename lists for testing the matching algorithm. Feel free to submit a PR to add more test cases. After modifying the file, run the unit test command to view the results.

Each code submission will trigger unit tests via GitHub Actions to ensure code quality.

### Building a Single File

On Windows, to build a single exe file with statically linked dependencies (without additional dynamic link DLL dependencies), download [these DLL files](https://github.com/qwqcode/qwqcode/releases/tag/dotnet-lib) and place them in the `native` directory. Then add the environment variable `ENABLE_NATIVE_LIBS=true` before compiling.

- https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/9503
- https://github.com/qwqcode/SubRenamer/blob/main/SubRenamer/SubRenamer.csproj

### Publish with NativeAOT

```bash
dotnet publish -r <RID> -c Release

# Build for Windows example
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release
```

### Build the installer with NSIS

NSIS installer `~13MB size`

```bash
pwsh ./publish.ps1
```

> If you build the installer with NSIS, you can ignore UPX compression for better startup performance.
